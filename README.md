# WFRP 4e Coins
A WFRP4e metacurrency module for FoundryVTT

The homebrew rule is that when players spend Fortune, the GM gets one reroll.

It works by listening to roll tests where fortune is spent (unfortunately it cannot make the distinction between when fortune is spent and a dark deal is made if fortune has already been used to reroll). It also listens for rerolls made where there is no fortune spent and the character is not a player character and reduces the GM's pool.

To install simply paste this into the module installation window: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aMediocreDad/coins/main/module.json`

I do not take feature requests, but welcome PRs.
